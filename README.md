# PyBer_Analysis
## Prompt One
Describe the purpose, or the reason, you did this assignment.
How did you analyze the data to create the technical deliverables?
What can be said about the summary DataFrame and multiple-line graph with respect to the ride-sharing data among the different city types? Include images of the summary DataFrame table and the multiple-line graph in these results.
A short summary of the results.
## Answer One
The purpose of this assignment was to get data points from the dataset that could tell us information about each city type. We analyzed the data by making multiple dataframes. Total rides increased from the lower third 'rural' to the middle third 'suburban' to the top third urban. The same linear progression in the upward motion was true for total drivers and total fares. In the case of average fare per ride the linear progression is reversed with average fare per ride being the highest for rural, then decending to suburban, and finally being the lowest for urban. The same can be said for the average fare per driver with it being the highest for rural and the lowest for urban with suburban respectifully in the middle. In summary, we can tell that the value of the ride goes up the more rural the area, but the rate of business rises the more urban the area is. That is what we can tell from the summary DataFrame. We can tell a few more things from the multiple-line graph. From the graph we see that in the middle we see a rise in the fare price for all city types. With urban staying level at the end, suburban raising in the end, and rural moving towards a decend in fare. 
## Prompt Two
What challenges or difficulties did you encounter? If none, then briefly explain what challenges or difficulties may be encountered and how to avoid them using technical analysis.
Explain how you overcame any challenges or difficulties, and include what technical analysis you use to overcome the challenges or difficulties.
## Answer Two
There were a few difficulties I ran into. Inititally was creating many diffirent kinds of data frames. Another one was merging data frames together. Finally, getting all the pieces together correctly to make the multi-line chart. This challenge was certainly a challenge, but I learned things from it.
## Prompt Three
Based on the data from the different city types, what recommendations would you give the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types?
Provide two additional analyses you could do to gain more insight into the data, like using other datasets.
What technical steps would you take to perform the additional analyses?
## Answer Three
Conserning disparities among city types my first recomendation would be simply, the more data the better. The more we know about the riders, drivers and cities, could hold potential to perform better, more detailed anlyses. The first additional analysis I would try to do would be a satisfaction dimension. How I would do this is implement a survey aspect of the app or means of using the service, for both drivers and passengers. Another additional analysis I would perform is one that deals with the duration of the rides. This could be useful in recommending more efficient routes for drivers to better serve passengers amongst other things. This could be done easily with software modifications to the app that the drivers use that could be linked with whatever navigation service they are using.
